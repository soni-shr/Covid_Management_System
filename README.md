# Covid-Management-System
Database Management and Design Project

Coronavirus outbreak has transpired over the past two years and since then the infection has spread rapidly, worldwide resulting in a lockdown of educational institutes, restaurants, and offices. The main objective of the project is to ensure smooth and safe functioning and working of the university by implementing a database management system that tracks, monitors, and controls the covid spread.

Refer DMDD Project Report to understand the project idea. The Final ERD Report consists of the Entity Relationship Diagram with the tables created and relationship between them. Run “SQLQueryCreate queries.sql” to setup database with all the tables Run “SQLQueryInsert queries.sql” to populate the database tables Run “SQLQuery queries.sql” to create procedures, views, functions and triggers
